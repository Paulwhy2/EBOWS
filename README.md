# Welcome to the East Bay Open Water Swim group!
## Who We Are:
We are a loose knit group of open water swimmers located on the east side of San Francisco Bay in California, USA.  We swim mostly at Keller Beach in Richmond, but also at Berkeley Marina, Albany Bulb Beach, Alameda South Beach and Encinal Beach and other locations.  We use a Gaggle listserv that helps us to find swim buddies and circulate other open water information about races, wildlife around Keller Cove, etc.  If you are an experienced open water swimmer and would like to join us, please sign up here:

**Everyone in this group swims at their own risk. Know your limits and be safe.**

If you are interested in swimming at the Albany Bulb Beach, swimmers there have a separate list you can join:   [https://groups.google.com/u/0/g/albany-bulb-swimmers.](https://groups.google.com/u/0/g/albany-bulb-swimmers)

## Where we swim:
[Here's a link to the map of the location for the beach](https://goo.gl/maps/tWxdJMU2ggC74wLU8)

Park on the street above the beach. Make sure you do not leave any valuables visible, or even any blankets that look like they might be covering up valuables. There have been a lot of car break-ins over the years. Break-ins are much less likely if you park on the other side of the tunnel, near the Mechanics Bank, but then it will be a longer walk and it's kind of cold and windy walking through the tunnel.  Or you can park on Western Drive (see map), but there may be limited parking.  Your car key can be wrapped in a paper towel and then a zip lock bag or better yet, a waterproof pouch.  If you've got a safer swimmer buoy(recommended for carrying stuff, so you can lean on it to rest in case of cramps, and so other swimmers can see you), you can put your key and other small valuables inside that. If you don't have one, you may be able to put it in another swimmer's buoy.   

Since I joined the listserv in 2013, there have been about four instances of clothes getting stolen off the wall where we leave stuff,  so definitely don't leave valuables or difficult to replace items like prescription glasses on the beach. Leave them in your car (hidden) or put them in  your buoy within a waterproof pouch. I found out the hard way that salt water peels the very expensive anti-glare and anti-scratch coatings off the glasses.   

The group meets on the far end of the beach, directly downhill from the restroom building, and we put our stuff on the wall. 

Sunday morning is the most popular time for swims, usually there's are also some before-work swims, and there is often a swim or two at noon on weekdays.  With the expansion of work-from-home and more flexible weekdays, there are often swims during the day on weekdays. When we're on daylight savings time, some sunset/after work swims happen as well.  You can wait and join when other people put out a call, or you can put out a call of your own by emailing the whole list (send to east-bay-open-water-swim@googlegroups.com).  

When you go out for the first few times, you'll want to make sure other swimmers know that you're a first-timer/new so you can arrange to buddy up with someone about your speed (they'll usually want to know what your speed is for the mile in a pool or open water). We are a friendly group -- we even have "swag" you can purchase, in the form of a lovely [Keller Cove mug](https://forms.gle/uNJQbGSKkkkzEZBeA) designed by a frequent Keller swimmer, Judith Greene-Janse: https://forms.gle/uNJQbGSKkkkzEZBeA.  

You can rent a wetsuit at SportsBasement, and the rental price can count towards a purchase of that suit or a different one, or you can swim "skin" with just a regular bathing suit and no wet suit.  A thermal cap can still be helpful though -- they have these also at Sports Basement and Transports or you can find one online (swim buoys may be found in the same places).

Regarding swimming in the rain:  some of us continue to swim through the rain, while others are more cautious due to concerns about runoff and water quality, and they wait a day or two before swimming again. It's your choice how you decide to handle the rain situation.

Earplugs are recommended to avoid both swimmers' ear and "surfers' ear", and also to prevent dizziness/queasiness from cold water getting into the ear canal.

Tide info at this link:  http://ca.usharbors.com/monthly-tides/California-San%20Francisco%20Bay/San%20Francisco/2016-05
When the tide is coming in, we usually swim towards the pylons (towards the Golden Gate), so as to catch a "tide ride" on the way back. When it's an ebb tide, we'll swim towards the Chevron Pier (north towards the Richmond-San Rafael bridge) to get a helpful pull on the way back.
